# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain
documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work
  in. (Directory does not exist yet; will be created lazily on the
  first ADR.)

If either file or directory doesn't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't
flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer
skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions
actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a **single-context repo**:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/                     ← (created lazily, not yet present)
│   ├── 0001-...md
│   └── 0002-...md
└── apps/
    └── web/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor
proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in
`CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal —
either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider)
or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather
than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…_
